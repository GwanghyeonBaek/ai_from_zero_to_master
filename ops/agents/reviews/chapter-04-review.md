- Inputs: `AGENT_QUALITY.md`, `master_plan_mlcc.md`, `mlcc_analysis.json`, `ops/agents/reviews/chapter-04-request.md`

## Score & Decision
- **Total: 82/100**
- **Verdict: PASS**

### Rubric (deterministic)
- MLCC coverage alignment (25): **21**
  - Evidence: classification visualization prep (CM/ROC/PR intent), regression visualization bridge, bias-aware reporting in roadmap.
- Concept depth/accuracy (25): **19**
  - Evidence: chart selection, distortion prevention, annotation/story, accessibility topics present.
- Practice executability/difficulty (20): **16**
  - Evidence: 12-problem set + runnable dashboard sample command.
- Evaluation/evidence measurability (20): **17**
  - Evidence: rubric + gate + evidence checklist present.
- Completion viability (10): **9**
  - Evidence: progression from basic charts to decision storytelling with gate to ML chapter.

## Critical Defects
- None triggered.

## Actionable Improvements (non-blocking)
1. Add fixed checklist for ROC/PR and confusion matrix visual package acceptance.
2. Add mandatory caption template (question, key finding, action) to standardize assessment.
