# Re-Review Request: Chapter 00 Orientation

Applied fixes from `chapter-00-review.md`:
- Added missing DoD artifacts: setup-proof, venv-proof, git-hygiene, auth-decision, plan-14days, plan-90days, ai-safety-checklist, orientation-retrospective.
- Updated checklist to link each row to concrete filenames.
- Added explicit rerun-from-scratch proof details.
- Added remote push evidence details (redacted URL + hash + timestamp).

Please re-run deterministic quality review for chapter 00.
