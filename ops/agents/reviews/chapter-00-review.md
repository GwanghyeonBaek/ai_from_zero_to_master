- Timestamp (UTC): 2026-02-21 13:23
- Inputs: `AGENT_QUALITY.md`, `master_plan_mlcc.md`, `mlcc_analysis.json`, `chapter-00-rerequest.md`, updated `curriculum/00-orientation/*`

## Score & Decision
- **Total: 90/100**
- **Verdict: PASS**

### Rubric (deterministic)
- MLCC coverage alignment (25): **22**
  - Evidence: orientation roadmap includes MLCC-aligned bridges (data quality/generalization/fairness principle).
- Concept depth/accuracy (25): **21**
  - Evidence: lessons + roadmap + safety/auth/git docs now concretely defined.
- Practice executability/difficulty (20): **18**
  - Evidence: previously missing DoD artifacts now present (`setup-proof.md`, `venv-proof.md`, `git-hygiene.md`, `auth-decision.md`, `plan-14days.md`, `plan-90days.md`, `ai-safety-checklist.md`, `orientation-retrospective.md`).
- Evaluation/evidence measurability (20): **19**
  - Evidence: evidence checklist now links each item to explicit file paths and proof sections.
- Completion viability (10): **10**
  - Evidence: gate flow and anti-dropout protocol intact, no missing blocker artifacts.

## Critical Defects
- None triggered.

## Re-review Result vs Prior
- Prior: **57/100 FAIL**
- Current: **90/100 PASS**
- Defects resolved: missing DoD artifacts, missing rerun proof detail, missing remote push proof detail.

## Remaining Improvements (non-blocking)
1. Add one screenshot/log attachment index in `evidence/README.md` for faster external auditor verification.
