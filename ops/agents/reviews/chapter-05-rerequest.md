# Re-Review Request: Chapter 05 ML Fundamentals

Applied fixes from `chapter-05-review.md`:
- Replaced placeholder lessons ml-01~ml-12 with concept-specific content (definition/assumptions/tradeoffs/failure modes/worked example).
- Made labs deterministic with input data path, exact run command, expected artifacts, acceptance thresholds.
- Expanded all lab solutions with concrete code snippets and expected metric ranges.
- Added per-lab scoring rows (LAB-01~12, LEAK-01~03) and linked each lab to rubric row IDs.

Please re-run deterministic quality review for chapter 05.
